#LinkedList

This project allows for the creation of LinkedList objects to store longs. It dynamically allocates and deallocates memory as the size of the list grows and shrinks This list is doubly linked and circular, meaning the next field of the last node points to the first node and the pre field of the first node points to the last node.

Inside the src folder, you will find the source files for creating LinkedLists: LinkedList.c and LinkedList.h as well as a driver file main.c.
The source folder also contains .bat files for building and running the driver program with gcc.
You can also use CMake to generate a solution for a C compiler of your choice.
