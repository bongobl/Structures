#ArrayList

This project allows for the creation of ArrayList objects to store longs. It dynamically allocates and deallocates memory as the size of the array grows and shrinks.

Inside the src folder, you will find the source files for creating ArrayLists: ArrayList.c and ArrayList.h as well as a driver file main.c.
The source folder also contains .bat files for building and running the driver program with gcc.
You can also use CMake to generate a solution for a C compiler of your choice.
